# What Are Items?

Items are the individual food entries that make up a transaction. Each item represents a specific type of food being received, distributed, or processed in some way.


### Each Item Includes:

**🧮 Quantity / Amount**
The number or volume of the food item being logged.

**⚖️ Unit of Measurement**
How the quantity is measured — typically in kilograms (kg), but could also be another configured unit (e.g. Banana Boxes).

**🗂 Category**
The food category the item belongs to (e.g. Produce, Bakery, Dairy, etc.).

**❌ "Bad" on Arrival**

A field to indicate whether the item was unsuitable for use upon receipt.


This helps track food that was spoiled or otherwise unusable when it arrived at your organisation.

**📦 Transaction**
Every item relates to a single specific transaction
