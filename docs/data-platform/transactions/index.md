# Transactions

Transactions are the core way to log the movement of food within the AFRA Data Platform. Each transaction records the flow of food either coming into or going out of your organisation.

A transaction consists of one or more items, each describing a specific food type, quantity, unit, and category. Properly recording transactions helps ensure accurate data tracking, reporting, and analysis.
