# Filtering Transactions

As you continue using the Data Platform, you'll likely accumulate a large number of transactions. To help you manage them, weâ€™ve added filters to make the Transactions page easier to navigate.

### Navigate to the Transactions Page
ðŸ‘‰ [https://data.afra.org.nz/transactions](https://data.afra.org.nz/transactions)

### Click **"Show Filters"**

- On **laptops or desktops**, the filter panel will appear on the **left** side.
- On **mobiles or tablets**, it will slide in from the **right** as a drawer.

### Choose Your Filters

- **Organisation**  
  Filter transactions by the **name** of the connected organisation.

- **Region**  
  Filter transactions by the **region** of the connected organisation.

- **Transaction Type**  
  Filter transactions based on their **type**.

- **Transaction Date**  
  Filter transactions by **date**. The selected date range is **inclusive**, meaning it includes the start and end dates you choose.
