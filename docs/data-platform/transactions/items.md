What Are Items?

Items are the individual food entries that make up a transaction. Each item represents a specific type of food being received, distributed, or processed in some way.



Each Item Includes:





üßÆ Quantity / Amount





The number or volume of the food item being logged.



‚öñÔ∏è Unit of Measurement





How the quantity is measured ‚Äî typically in kilograms (kg), but could also be another configured unit (e.g. Banana Boxes).



üóÇ Category





The food category the item belongs to (e.g. Produce, Bakery, Dairy, etc.).



See the full list of categories here



‚ùå "Bad" on Arrival





A checkbox to indicate whether the item was unsuitable for use upon receipt.



This helps track food that was spoiled or otherwise unusable when it arrived at your organisation.



Transaction





Every item relates to a single specific transaction

Understanding Units in the AFRA Data Platform

What Are Units?

Units are a multiplier applied to the quantity of each food item in a transaction. They standardize how food volumes are recorded, making data meaningful and comparable across different organisations.



AFRA‚Äôs Recommended Practice

üìè Weigh all food items
AFRA strongly recommends that members weigh every item coming in and going out, and record the weight in kilograms (kg). This provides the most accurate and consistent data for reporting and analysis.



Alternative Units: Banana Boxes & Others

ü•≠ Some members have historically used alternative units, most commonly:





Banana Boxes, often estimated at 10‚Äì15 kg per box



Other containers or local measures specific to their workflows

The AFRA Data Platform supports these units by allowing each one to be configured with a specific kilogram equivalent. For example:







Unit



Multiplier (kg)





Banana Box



13 kg





Crate



10 kg
