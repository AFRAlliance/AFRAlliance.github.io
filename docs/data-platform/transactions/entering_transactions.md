Adding Transaction data is how you log food that you have received, distributed or has been passed down the waste hierarchy.

### Before You Start

**Ask yourself:**

1. 📥 Is the food coming in or going out?
2. 🏢 Which organisation is this transaction related to?
3. 🥫 For each type of food:

> - Quantity (how much?)
> - Unit of measurement (e.g. kilograms, banana boxes)
> - Category (see our list of food categories)

### Entering the Food into the Platform

#### Log in to the AFRA Data Platform
👉 https://data.afra.org.nz
🔐 See how to log in here

#### Navigate to the Transactions Page
👉 https://data.afra.org.nz/transactions


#### Click "Create New Transaction"

#### Select the Transaction Type

#### Choose whether the food is incoming or outgoing

> (Note: We do not currently differentiate between types of distribution)

#### Select the Related Organisation

This is the organisation the food is coming from or going to

👉 See how to add an organisation here

#### Adjust the Date (if needed)

The system defaults to today’s date — update if the transaction occurred earlier.

#### Add Food Items

For each item, enter:

- Quantity
- Unit of measurement
- Food category
- If the item arrived and you consider it 'bad'

#### Submit the Transaction
✅ Click “Submit Transaction” when all items are added.
