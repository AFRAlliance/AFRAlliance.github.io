# Feedback & Roadmap
We love feedback and appreciate anything that you would like to share.

Day to day feedback on things such as feature suggestions, and bug reports can be submitted to our Data Lead, Quinn Moffat via quinn@afra.org.nz

## Roadmap & Current Development Focus

Our development efforts are structured around four key strands, each aimed at enhancing the value and impact of our data systems:


### Simplifying Data Entry
Streamlining the process of inputting data to reduce user burden, minimize errors, and improve overall efficiency. This includes intuitive interfaces, smart defaults, and automated data capture where possible.

### Improving Data Quality
Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data through validation rules, real-time feedback, and better user guidance during data entry.

### Powerful Data Reporting
Enhancing our ability to extract meaningful insights through flexible, user-friendly reporting tools. Emphasis is on customizable dashboards, visualizations, and drill-down capabilities.

### Data for Advocacy
Leveraging data to drive change — equipping stakeholders with compelling evidence for policy influence, funding proposals, and public engagement. This includes tailored reports and storytelling with data.
