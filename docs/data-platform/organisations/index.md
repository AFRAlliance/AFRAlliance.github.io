# Organisations

In the AFRA Data Platform, an organisation represents a group or entity involved in the food network—such as a food bank, community group, distributor, or supplier. Organisations are key to tracking where food comes from and where it goes.

Each transaction is linked to at least one organisation, providing context and enabling detailed reporting on food flow across the network.

## How Does the Organisation Page Work?

The Organisation page lets you:

* View details of existing organisations within your space
* Search and filter organisations for quick access
* From here, you can easily add new organisations.
