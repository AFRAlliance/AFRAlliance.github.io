# Filtering Organisations

As you use the Data Platform, you may work with a large number of Organisations. To make it easier to find what you're looking for, the Organisations page includes a set of filters.

### Navigate to the Organisations Page  
ğŸ‘‰ [https://data.afra.org.nz/organisations](https://data.afra.org.nz/organisations)

### Click **"Show Filters"**

- On **laptops or desktops**, the filter panel will appear on the **left** side.
- On **mobiles or tablets**, it will slide in from the **right** as a drawer.

### Choose Your Filters

- **Organisation**  
  Filter transactions by the **name** of the connected organisation.

- **Region**  
  Filter organisations based on the **region** they belong to.

- **Relationship Type**  
  Filter by the **relationship** the organisation typically has with Food Rescues (i.e., Donor or Receiver).

- **Previous Interaction**  
  Toggle to show only organisations your food rescue has previously recorded transactions with.

> ğŸ’¡ These filters help narrow down your search and make it easier to manage large lists of organisations.
